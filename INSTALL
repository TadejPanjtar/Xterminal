INSTALL: Installation procedures
Copyright (c) 1996-2002 Dragos Acostachioaie

Requirements:
  * gcc 2.6.8 or better
  * ncurses 1.8.6 or better
  * gpm 1.10 or better (optional)
  * S-Lang 1.0 or better (optional)

The steps in order to compile this package are:
  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system. If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile. While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

     The `configure' script is generated from `configure.in' by GNU's autoconf
     and it attempts to guess correct values for various system-dependent
     variables used during compilation. It also creates the Makefiles needed to
     compile the package and a `.h' file containing system-dependent
     definitions;

  2. Type `make' to compile the package;

  3. Type `make install' to install the library, the header files and the
     documentation. This operation should be done logged on as root;

  4. Type `make examples' if you wish to see some test programs. This will
     create some `ex*' files in the `example' directory;

  5. You can remove the library and object files from the source directory by
     typing `make clean'. To also remove the files that `configure' created
     (so you can compile the package for a different kind of system), type
     `make distclean';

  6. Type `make uninstall' to remove the library, the header files and the
     documentation from the destination directories.

Installation directories
    By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
    `/usr/include', `/usr/lib', etc. You can specify an installation prefix
    other than `/usr' by giving `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.

Other features and options
    --disable-shared to build a static version of the library
      instead of a shared one;
    --disable-signals to disable signals catching;
    --enable-debug to enable generation of debugging informations;
    --without-gpm if you don't want GPM mouse support;
    --with-slang to use S-Lang library instead of ncurses.
    For other options, type `./configure --help'.

Hope you have already read the `README' file.
