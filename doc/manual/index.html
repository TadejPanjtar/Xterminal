<h2><a name="description">Description</a></h2>

   <dd>First of all, Xterminal is a hierarchy of objects, based on a client-
server model. That means there is one or more objects acting like servers, each
one having some clients. Each of these clients may act as servers too, having
each one some clients. The various events that comes from the system (keyboard,
mouse events, signals, messages, and so on) are going to a server and he
decide which of his clients must receive the event, and so forth. If a server
is redrawn, he asks it's clients to redraw themselves, too, for example. Events
are not passed syncronous to objects, but using a queue, so if the system is
busy with other tasks, events are not loosed.<br>
   <dd>Each object have an unique identificator, and Xterminal maintains an
internal table to keep track of these objects. Objects can communicate one
with other using messages. Messages are translated into events and inserted
into the queue, too.<br>
</p><br>

<h2><a name="instalattion">Installation procedures</a></h2>

<li>The steps in order to compile the package<br>
  <dd><b>1.</b> `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and
     type `./configure' to configure the package for your system. If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.<br><br>

     Running `configure' takes awhile. While running, it prints some messages
     telling which features it is checking for.<br><br>

     The `configure' script is generated from `configure.in' by GNU's autoconf
     and it attempts to guess correct values for various system-dependent
     variables used during compilation. It also creates the Makefiles needed to
     compile the package and a `.h' file containing system-dependent
     definitions;<br><br>

  <dd><b>2.</b> Type `make' to compile the package;<br><br>

  <dd><b>3.</b> Type `make install' to install the library, the header files and
     the documentation. This operation should be done as root;<br><br>

  <dd><b>4.</b> Type `make examples' if you wish to see some test programs. This
     will create some `ex*' files in the `example' directory;<br><br>

  <dd><b>5.</b> You can remove the library and object files from the source
     directory by typing `make clean'. To also remove the files that
     `configure' created (so you can compile the package for a different kind of
     system), type `make distclean';<br><br>

  <dd><b>6.</b> Type `make uninstall' to remove the library, the header files
     and the documentation from the destionation directories.

<br>
<li>Installation directories<br>
   <dd>By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/include', `/usr/lib', etc. You can specify an installation prefix
other than `/usr' by giving `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.<br><br>

<li>Other features and options<br>
   <dd>If you want to compile a static version of the library instead of a
shared one, you should use the option `--disable-shared'.<br>
   <dd>If you don't want mouse support, use the option `--without-gpm'.<br>
   <dd>For other options, type `./configure --help'.
</p><br>

<p>
<h2><a name="foundation">The foundation class: XObject</a></h2>

   <dd>Every class is derived from an abstract class, <i>XObject</i>. Each
instantiated XObject have an <i>object id</i> (identificator) associated to
it. The library itself maintains an internal table of instantiated classes.
There are three types of objects:<br>
- <i>abstract objects</i>, which cannot be instantiated, but only declared;
their purpose is to provide a general manipulation to a class of objects;<br>
- <i>passive objects</i>, which only displays something, but the user cannot
control them;<br>
- <i>active objects</i>, which the user can do something with them, and which
knows to answer in a way to the user input.<br><br>

<p>
<h2><a name="geometry">The geometrical classes: XPoint and XRect</a></h2>

   <dd><i>XPoint</i> is an abstraction for a geometrical two-dimensional
"point", having an <i>x</i> field (horizontal coordinate) and an <i>y</i> field
(vertical coordinate).<br><br>

<dd>Learn more about <a href="XPoint.html">XPoint</a>.<br><br>

   <dd><i>XRect</i> is an abstraction for a geometrical two-dimensional
"rectangle", having an <i>a</i> field of type <a href="XPoint.html">XPoint</a>
(the upper-left corner), and an <i>b</i> field of type <a href="XPoint.html">
XPoint</a> too (the bottom-right corner).<br><br>

<dd>Learn more about <a href="XRect.html">XRect</a>.<br><br>

</p><br>

<p>
<h2><a name="event">Events</a></h2>

   <dd>The events are not passed syncronously to the objects to which are
addressed, but using a event queue. That doesn't mean the events will be
delayed, anyway. The application will automatically query the system for
events (from keyboard, from mouse, messages from other objects, UNIX
signals), will find the object that event is addressed to, and will insert
them into the queue.<br>
    <dd>There is a basic event class, <i>XEvent</i>, and the other event classes
are derived from it.<br><br>

<li>Event "classes":<br>
   <dd>- EV_NOTHING, no event for an object;<br>
   <dd>- EV_KEYBOARD, an event from keyboard;<br>
   <dd>- EV_MOUSE, an event from mouse;<br>
   <dd>- EV_SIGNAL, a UNIX system signal;<br>
   <dd>- EV_MESSAGE, a message from an other object;<br>
   <dd>- EV_BROADCAST, an event received by all objects.<br><br>

   <dd>The Xterminal's event model is suggested by the picture below:<br><br>

<p>
<h2><a name="terminal">Accessing the terminal</a></h2>
   <dd>The terminal is accessed using the XTerminal class, which abstractize
the input/output operations with the terminal. This class is globally
instantiated as <i>XTerminal *Terminal</i>. This class allows you to control the
terminal input/output state, and provides methods to write to the terminal and
to get events (from keyboard or mouse) from it. Always remember that writing
something to the terminal does not imply screen update; the update is made only
at the XTerminal.Refresh() call.<br><br>

</p>

<p>
<h2><a name="library">Using the library</a></h2>

   <dd>In order to use the library, you must include Xterminal.h in your C++
programs. At the linking phase, you must have -lXterminal as parameter when
calling the C++ compiler. You may also need to use -lncurses -lgpm.<br>
   <dd>Any Xterminal application must first call <a href="functions.html#XInit">
XInit()</a> that initialize the terminal. The program also must call
<a href="functions.html#XDone">XDone()</a> before exit.<br><br>
