Mar 08, 1996 Yesterday I made, together with Adi Teohar, *revolutionary*
             changes :-) to the base of Xterminal. bobject.h vanished; now
             we have bclass.h, xobject.h and xobject.c. The generally part
             of the library is now ready. It works under Linux, too.
Feb 28, 1996 After a long :-( period of time, I started again: added a void
             *ptr field to the XMessage structure, so we can send pointers
             between objects, and some corrections with inserts in lists.
Dec 14, 1995 I made major changes to XPoint and XRect (bobject.h); added
             some basically operators.
Nov 10, 1995 I have just implemented the event queue.
Nov 03, 1995 I met Linus Torvalds at ROSE'95. I told him about that stupid
             thing with attributes and the thing is that Linux's curses is
             BSD 4 compatible, and he cannot change colors; forget about
             curses, new Slackwares uses ncurses, which is System V
             compatible, and can change colors. The best idea is to use
             ncurses (not only on Linux, but in other Unixes too) so to be a
             higher compatibility.
Oct 09, 1995 Some methods added in XObject: registerclient() to register the
             new client, calculatebounds() to adjust the new client's bounds
             to the server's bounds. I should do two important things: first,
             to use a message queue instead of older communication, and
             second, to use a public palette table instead of using a
             palette structure for every class.
Sep 28, 1995 Created event handler.
Aug 10, 1995 Created abstract.h, containing definitions for some abstract
             objects (Point, Rect).
Jul 23, 1995 Here starts my log: types.h created.
